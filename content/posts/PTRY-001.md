# Frist psosts

I just wanted to post something here, just to make sure I have at least some semblance of content up. I might get rid of this later if I feel like it, I still don't know what exactly I should use this site for. In the meantime, here's some poetry I wrote as a brain dump when I couldn't sleep. I really don't think there's any real meaning behind it, just a lot of esoteric bullshit. 

----------------------------------------------------------

heaven attracts the formless, 
the spindles, the spirals, chirals and fractals;
I can contort myself as much as space allows me to, 
but I won't find myself in heaven at the last knot or the infinite fraying and splaying. 

My body attracts its fair share of curses, 
the bleeding masses, reddened eyes shedding tears and the mouths that grow just to bite my skin,
they can stay and invite more of their kin,
if that place will take me; 

Fingers grown thin and scraping along the floor,
horns that grow back into my own skin 
grossly unparallel and grotesque shall I be, 
forever cursed but formless, 
heaven shall find me now, 
i need not seek it's entrance. 

------------------------------------------------------------- 

I stare down at the coast of the lost and the eyeless, 
footprints scsttered through the sand in chaos, 
washed away by the tide only to appear again,
bloated bodies stepped on and over,
they're the only idols of rest

I hear slithering to my left grow into a whisper, 
the words collide into my ear in an unfamiliar buzz getting louder and louder,
the serpent coils around a tree and dances side to side,
swaying and speaking in tongues 

The serpent leaves disappointed through the bridge that the bear broke,
through the house of the flycatcher and found its respite in the valley, 
the coast filled with more of them, 
crawling, pushing away and beating the bodies

I stood disgusted, in disbelief,
the buzzing returned without anything to accompany it, 
the eyeless gathered at the beach, staring at the sun, 
the beating continued and they started to pray, 
I prayed with them too,
i went on even after they stopped, 
even after the sky lost the sun,
i prayed because those words, I understood
